Overview of Project:
	The purpose of the project was to help Louise gather her data and create a visualization. In order to create the graphic visualizations, it was necessary to take the proper steps to find out each formula and place them in the correct columns. 
  Analysis and Challenges:
    During the process of creating images for the data, I encounted several different challenges when it came to coding. For example, I struggled with the COUNTIFS formulas when I was calculate the percentages for each column. Calculating the SUMS for each category was not difficult, but once it came to the percentage, I was unsure how to only make it out of 125%. Due to this reason, the graph that was produced from this data was not the same as the example. 
Results: 
  Although the results did not mirror the example that was given, I would say that the work was completed to the best of my knowledge. These are functions that I have never used or worked with while using Excel, therefore I would say I am still impressed with the information that was produced from the data. 
  Theature Outcomes by Launch Date Results:
    The Theature Outcomes by Launch Date had much better results compared to the Outcomes based on Goals. The results showed that more people attened than failed to show up or cancel. The graph had a clear indication between the three outcomes and was extremly easy to interpret the data. Even though there is a clear portion of the line chart for the "canceled" outcome, it shows the data is being displayed through the "failed" and "succesful" lines. 
  Outcomes Based on Goals:
    A few conclusions that came from the outcomes is that both outcomes, successful and failed, ended up being the same amount. As one rose, the other fell, three times they met and the outcomes came out to be complete opposite of each other. Another conclusion I noticed and was surprised about was that the successful outcomes never had a 100% outcome rate, but the failed outcomes did. 
    Overall, the data was presented despite the difficulty of learning and understanding the forumlas. It became much easier to understand when viewing the recommended tables and graphs and seeing the similarity between what was created and what was shown in the module.
